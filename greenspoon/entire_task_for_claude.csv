By 1989 there were approximately 900 individuals in 13 groups. However, after the break up of the Soviet Union only 350 individuals remained as a result of poaching.    A drastic decline in the Dachigam Hangul population was reported soon after 1947, when the 3,000-5,000 animals estimated in the early 1900s suddenly dropped to 180 animals in 1965, although there are considerable doubts of the veracity of the earlier population estimates (Gee 1965, Mukesh et al. 2015, M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016).       In China, C. h. yarkandensis had a declining population of about 4,000–5,000 in 1991, scattered along the Tarim and Karakax rivers, central Xinjiang Province (Gu Jinghe 1991, Wilson and Mittermeier 2011).",5209.4516
